Project: CKC Badge

For CackalackyCon 2026, I worked an embedded systems application developed in C and C++ for conference badges that enabled attendees to participate in games and interact with each other in real time. This project faced significant challenges, including optimizing energy usage to extend battery life, managing memory efficiently to conserve resources, and using communication protocols like BLE and MQTT to facilitate communication between badges, as well as with a central server. Additionally, the badge is designed to hold up against attacks from conference attendees, which required robust hardening measures, such as using hardware tokens to tie firmware to the device.
